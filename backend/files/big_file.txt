Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;

console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.

It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere.

console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value.

Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.
These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.

It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();

var apple = "apple";

function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";

}

What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();

The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
Eg2.)

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
What is Scope?
Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain.

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;

var b = 10;
a();

Scope refers to the context or region in your code where a variable or function is accessible. 
What is Lexical Scope?
Lexical or Static scope refers to the accessibility of variables, functions and objects based on physical location in source code.
What is Lexical Environment?
Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, the Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent. Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space).



What is a Scope Chain?
The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexical environment chain. 

Eg1.)

function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();

var apple = "apple";


function isApple() {
  console.log(apple);
}
function isBanana() {
  var apple = "banana";
  isApple();
}


isBanana();


What is Block scope?
It defines a scope that is limited to the block of code enclosed by curly braces {}.
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const c = 30;
}

* Reason?
    * In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as *undefined* as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    * While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    * Thus we say, *let* and *const* are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

In the functions also, we have { } curly braces(block), but the variables inside the function are added to the block scope in the chrome dev tools why?



Even deeper example:

Var is function scoped, So, we can also access it anywhere inside the function, even inside the block which is present inside the function.

But ‘let’ is a block-scoped, it can only can be accessed inside the blocks. 

Inner block variables cannot be accessed outside of it.
However, Outler block variables can be accessed inside the inner block.
Here, exampleFunction(){ … } curly braces represent the outer block and the {...} curly braces inside the function represent the inner block.













What is the difference between function scope and block scope?


What is a temporal dead zone?
let and const declarations are hoisted. But its different from var
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
console.log(b); // prints undefined as expected
let a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
var b = 15;
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 15
It looks like let isn't hoisted, but it is, let's understand
Both a and b are actually initialized as undefined in hoisting stage. But var b is inside the storage space of GLOBAL, and a is in a separate memory object called script, where it can be accessed only after assigning some value to it first ie. one can access 'a' only if it is assigned. Thus, it throws error.

In the above example, you can see that, var a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with undefined value. It can be accessed before initialisation without any errors) and attached to global object. In this case of var, placeholder ‘undefined’ is added, so no error when console logging. 

In the above example, you can see that, let a is hoisted(i.e., var a is added in memory create phase with no placeholders like ‘undefined’(because value unavailable. The value will be available to the memory phase only after the assigning value to a). It will not work as same as the variable attached to the global obect, so only, the new/seperate memory object classed ‘script’  is created for let & const variables. In this case of let, placeholder ‘undefined’ is not added, so error shows when console logging. There is not placeholder for let and const variables in anywhere. Instead of placeholder, directly value will be added to the let a after we assigning the value by ourself. So the time between when a is added to memory object ‘script’ with no value(<Value unavailable>) till the time when the javascript reads the code line where the let a is assigned some value.
The above example is made with the use case of global level. See the below example of showing in the function level. Compare the both.

Also, see the example using block level,



Temporal Dead Zone : Time since when the let variable was hoisted until it is initialized some value.
So any line till before "let a = 10" is the TDZ for a
Since a is not accessible on global, its not accessible in window/this also. window.b or this.b -> 15; But window.a or this.a ->undefined, just like window.x->undefined (x isn't declared anywhere)
What are the three types of errors related to variables?
Reference Error are thrown when variables are in temporal dead zone.
Syntax Error doesn't even let us run single line of code.
let a = 10;
let a = 100;  //this code is rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (duplicate declaration)

------------------
let a = 10;
var a = 100; // this code also rejected upfront as SyntaxError. (can't use same name in same scope).

By seeing below code, var a and let b are having different memory object called ‘Global’ and ‘Script’. Both are in global level, they can be accessible in global level. When you change the variable name as same for both. Example if you give like,
Var a = 10;
Let a = 20;

It will through error as  ‘a is already declared’. This is because they both are accessible in this same scope of region Or In a same region, two variable named with same name leads to error. If you make it on different scopes, then error will removed. Like this,
Var a = 20;
{
Let b = 40;
}
Let is a stricter version of var. Now, const is even more stricter than let.
let a;
a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10. Note declaration and assigning of a is in different lines.
------------------
const b;
b = 10;
console.log(b); // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (This type of declaration won't work with const. const b = 10 only will work)
------------------
const b = 100;
b = 1000; //this gives us TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.




Absolutely, if an interviewer asks you to explain the logic behind the behavior of typeof null returning "object" in JavaScript, here's how you could explain it:


Historical Quirk: JavaScript was created in a relatively short amount of time and evolved rapidly, which led to certain quirks and inconsistencies in its design. One of these quirks is the behavior of typeof null.


Early Design Choices: In the early days of JavaScript, its creators designed the language to be used for both object-oriented and functional programming. They used a tagging system in the underlying implementation to differentiate between different types of values. For example, the tagging system was used to distinguish between objects and primitive values like numbers and strings.


Tagging System: Objects in JavaScript are internally tagged with a value that indicates their type. The tag for objects happens to be represented by the binary pattern 000 in memory. However, the tag for null was also set to 000, likely due to an oversight or design decision made early in the language's development.


Consequences: As a result of this tagging system design, when JavaScript checks the type of null using the typeof operator, it mistakenly interprets the 000 pattern as an object type, leading to the result "object".


Compatibility Concerns: Changing this behavior in later versions of JavaScript could have potentially broken existing code that relies on the historical behavior of typeof null. Since JavaScript prioritizes backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code, this quirk has been maintained over time.

The behavior of typeof null returning "object" is a result of early design choices in JavaScript's development, where null was incorrectly tagged with the same pattern used for objects. This quirk has persisted due to the language's emphasis on backward compatibility and the challenges of modifying behavior that existing code relies on.



Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters in the variable name can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Interview questions related to JavaScript type coercion, string concatenation, and operators could include:

What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another when certain operations are performed. For example, when using the + operator with a string and a number, type coercion converts the number to a string before concatenating.


Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
The == operator performs type coercion before comparing values, while the === operator performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example, 1 == '1' is true because of type coercion, but 1 === '1' is false because it's a strict comparison.

What is the result of 5 + '5' in JavaScript?
The result is '55'. The number 5 is coerced into a string, and then the two strings are concatenated together.

How can you prevent unwanted type coercion in JavaScript?
To prevent unwanted type coercion, you can use the strict equality operator === when comparing values. This ensures that both the values and their types are the same.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
null represents the intentional absence of any value or object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
Truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy values are values that are considered as false when evaluated in a Boolean context. Examples of falsy values include 0, false, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string.

What does the + operator do in JavaScript?
The + operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, it performs addition. When used with at least one string, it performs string concatenation.

What is NaN in JavaScript?
NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from an arithmetic operation. It's often used to indicate that a mathematical operation has failed.

How can you explicitly convert a value to a string in JavaScript?
You can use the String() constructor or the .toString() method to explicitly convert a value to a string.

What is the difference between type coercion and type conversion?
Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values when performing operations, while type conversion is the explicit conversion of values using built-in functions or methods.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.

These questions delve into the concepts of type coercion, data types, operators, and how JavaScript handles different value types in various situations.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that are considered as true when evaluated in a Boolean context. When a truthy value is used in a conditional statement, such as an if statement, it is treated as if it were true. Here are the common truthy values in JavaScript:
Non-empty Strings: Any non-empty string is considered truthy.


Numbers: Any non-zero number, positive or negative, is truthy.


Objects: Any object, including arrays and functions, is truthy.


Arrays: Even an empty array is considered truthy.


Functions: Any defined function is considered truthy.


Truthy Expressions: Expressions that evaluate to true, such as the result of a comparison like 1 < 2, are truthy.


Everything else: Most values are truthy in JavaScript, with the exception of falsy values (e.g., false, 0, null, undefined, NaN, and an empty string '').


Here's an example demonstrating truthy values:
if ('hello') {
  console.log("This will be executed because 'hello' is truthy.");
}

if (42) {
  console.log("This will be executed because 42 is truthy.");
}

if ([]) {
  console.log("This will be executed because an empty array is truthy.");
}

In these examples, the statements within the if blocks will be executed because the values being evaluated are truthy.
In JavaScript, undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. There are a few scenarios where undefined can occur:
Variable Declaration: If a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value will be undefined.

 let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
 Missing Function Arguments: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, the missing arguments will have the value undefined.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
Property Access: Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will also result in undefined.

 const person = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(person.age); // Output: undefined
Return Value: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it will implicitly return undefined.

 function noReturnValue() {}
console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined
Explicit Assignment: A variable can be explicitly assigned the value undefined.

 let explicitUndefined = undefined;
console.log(explicitUndefined); // Output: undefined
It's important to differentiate between null and undefined in JavaScript. While both represent the absence of a value, they are used in slightly different contexts. null is often used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically indicates that a value is missing or hasn't been defined yet.
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialising/assigning value without getting error and this is happening due to the 1st phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution Context.

getName(); // Namaste Javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
